"""Domain exceptions raised by the service layer, plus their HTTP mapping.

Services raise these instead of ``HTTPException``. A single FastAPI handler
(registered via ``register_exception_handlers``) maps them to responses, so
new exception types (e.g. RBAC's future ``PermissionDeniedError``) only need
a subclass with a ``status_code`` — no per-route wiring.
