"""Resolve the request's AccessScope.

Sync ``def``, not ``async def``, and the distinction is not cosmetic: this runs
a database query on every request and the data layer is synchronous SQLAlchemy.
FastAPI runs a ``def`` dependency in a threadpool and an ``async def`` one
directly on the event loop, so declaring it async would block the loop once per
request. ``get_db`` is already a sync generator; this matches it. The rule to
hold: stay consistently sync along the whole call path rather than mixing,
which hides the blocking.
