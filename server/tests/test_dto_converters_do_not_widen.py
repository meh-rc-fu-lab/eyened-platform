"""What the database-reading DTO converters actually return.

``test_repository_reads_are_scoped.py`` pins their *names* -- ``_DTO_SESSION_TOUCHES``
is an exact set, so a converter that starts reading, or a rename of one of the
five on it, turns that guard red. It observes nothing about what any of them
returns: replacing ``_get_public_id_for_instance_id``'s body with
``return "leaked-public-id"`` left the whole suite green.

``form_annotation_to_get`` is tested here too and is no longer one of them: it
came off that set when it stopped resolving an image id from the raw Session.
Its test below is kept here for the widening assertion, which is the same
property in a converter that now has only what it was handed.

This file is the behavioural half, and it is *in addition* to that pin, not
instead of it. Every converter here except that one reads through a raw
``Session`` with no scope in the chain, so the property that keeps them honest
is not filtering --
it is that each resolves only identifiers already carried by the row it was
handed. So every test seeds a second project the caller cannot reach, converts
a row from the first, and asserts twice:

- the resolved identifier equals the in-reach image's PublicID exactly, which
  is what catches a converter fabricating or substituting a value; and
- the out-of-reach PublicID appears nowhere in the serialized output, which is
  what catches a converter widening its read.

An absence assertion alone would pass for a converter that returned a constant,
and an equality assertion alone would pass for one that returned the right
value *and* extra rows. Both are needed.

Not a claim that these converters are scoped. They are not, and
``_DTO_SESSION_TOUCHES`` says so; routing them through a scoped repository is
the long-term answer and is out of scope here.
