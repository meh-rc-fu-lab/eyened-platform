"""Two unbounded powers, each pinned to an explicit allow-list.

Every write path to Creator.IsAdmin is an escalation path: making the column
load-bearing turns any endpoint that can set it into a way to become an
administrator. It is clean by construction today -- create_user takes no such
argument, so /auth/register and OIDC auto-provision both land at the False
default -- but that list is only exhaustive if it stays that way, and it is
what keeps the deferred registration modes from opening a hole when they land.

The second power, an unbounded AccessScope, has two doors: AccessScope.trusted()
and the constructor with is_admin=True. Both are guarded, because guarding only
the first would leave a green suite and an open door.

These guards are allow-lists over source, so they are exact-set assertions on
purpose: a file that stops needing the power must leave the list, and the test
failing is how you find out.

Their bound, stated exactly. Both scan for a syntactic shape, so what they
prove is "no file outside the list contains this shape", not "no file outside
the list obtains the power". The constructor guard matches the ``is_admin=``
keyword only; ``AccessScope`` is ``kw_only=True`` so a positional third
argument no longer exists, but an alias (``S = AccessScope; S(is_admin=True)``),
``**kwargs`` expansion, ``dataclasses.replace`` and ``object.__setattr__`` are
all invisible to it, as ``setattr(creator, "IsAdmin", True)`` is to the
IsAdmin guard. Files under a ``tests`` path component are not scanned at all.
Nothing here bounds those; review does.
