"""Every route touching project data resolves its service through a scoped factory.

The complement to the repository guard: that one proves a read filters, this
one proves the route got a filtered repository in the first place. A route
added later that calls ``get_db`` directly and builds its own repository would
pass the first guard and fail this one.

The two exemption lists below are deliberately separate, because they are two
different claims. ``_NO_PROJECT_DATA`` says the route serves nothing a project
membership governs. ``_UNGATED_PROJECT_DATA`` says the opposite -- the route
does serve project data and is known to be unscoped today. Folding the second
into the first is how a guard turns an open hole into a documented guarantee.

Both lists, and the discovered-unscoped set they are checked against, are
keyed on ``f"{sorted(route.methods)} {route.path}"`` -- not on ``route.path``
alone. FastAPI can register a second route at the same path under a different
method -- a hypothetical ``DELETE /import/status/{task_id}`` alongside the
``GET`` already exempted here (no such ``DELETE`` exists today); keying on the
path only would make that second, unrelated route silently exempt too, with
the set-equality ratchet below still green.
