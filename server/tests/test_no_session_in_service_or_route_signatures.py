"""Guards that no layer above the repository touches the database.

Repositories take a Session by constructor injection and only flush(); services
take repositories and never hold a Session; get_db (server/db.py) owns the
request transaction.

Two guards live here:

1. Signature guard (test_no_service_holds_a_session,
   test_no_route_handler_holds_a_session): no function under server/services
   or server/routes takes/annotates a parameter as a Session, except a small
   declared exception set (_SIGNATURE_ALLOWED below) plus the get_*_service
   composition-root factories (_is_di_factory).

2. Direct-DB-access guard (test_no_direct_db_access_in_service_or_route_functions):
   a stronger, independent check. The exceptions below weaken guard 1 (several
   functions legitimately hold a Session parameter), so this guard scans for
   the thing that actually matters -- a bare `session`/`db` local or parameter
   being used to touch the database directly (``session.query(...)``,
   ``db.execute(...)``, etc). Repository/AuditService internals reach the
   database via ``self._session.method(...)``, which this pattern deliberately
   does not match: the call's receiver is an attribute access on ``self``, not
   a bare ``session``/``db`` name, and repositories owning the session is the
   design, not a violation of it.

Exemptions, and what would remove them:

- server/routes/import_api.py::import_single_image is exempted by name in
  both guards -- not a whole-file exclusion; an earlier version of this guard
  skipped the entire file, which would have hidden any handler later added to
  it. Human decision: that module is slated for deprecation and will not be
  converted. It legitimately holds a Session for ``ImportRun.apply()`` and for
  the explicit ``session.rollback()`` on its caught-failure path.
- audit_service.py's ``_drain``/``_clear`` are SQLAlchemy ``after_commit`` /
  ``after_rollback`` event-listener callbacks; SQLAlchemy dictates their
  ``(session)`` signature. They are part of the already-declared AuditService
  audit-sink exception: an earlier ``_ALLOWED`` named only
  ``AuditService.__init__``, which was a clerical gap, not a design decision.
- Five auth resolvers (``get_current_user``, ``check_login``,
  ``check_oidc_login``, ``CurrentUser.get_creator``, ``creator_to_response``)
  legitimately read/write ``Creator`` directly ahead of the request's
  authorization scope existing. Three still live in ``routes/auth.py``;
  ``get_current_user`` and ``CurrentUser.get_creator`` moved to
  ``services/current_user.py`` to delete the ``services -> routes`` import
  edge, and their entries below are **re-keyed to that path, not dropped** --
  the move changed where they live, not that they hold a Session.
- Seven auth.py route handlers (``login``, ``get_token``,
  ``get_current_user_info``, ``change_password``, ``register_user``,
  ``refresh_token``, ``oidc_authenticate``) hold ``session`` ONLY to forward
  it to one of the five resolvers above, or to ``create_user`` (also a
  declared exception). ``change_password``/``register_user`` separately depend
  on ``AuditService`` via ``Depends(get_audit_service)``, a DI factory
  parameter -- structurally exempt (``_is_di_factory`` below), not a session
  forward. An earlier exemption set covered the resolver callees but never
  named the callers that must obtain and forward the session -- fixing that
  omission is what this set is. What would remove it: converting the auth resolvers
  into FastAPI dependencies, so route handlers stop receiving a Session at
  all and have nothing left to forward. That conversion is out of scope for
  this guard.

Blind spot: both scans key on the bare names ``session``/``db`` (parameter
name for guard 1, call-receiver name for guard 2), so a local alias (e.g.
``s = db; s.query(...)``) would evade both. Currently inert -- every DB entry
point in scope arrives as a ``Depends(get_db)`` parameter, and guard 1's
annotation check (``text.endswith("Session")``) still catches the
parameter-rename variant -- but a future maintainer introducing such an alias
would not be caught here.
