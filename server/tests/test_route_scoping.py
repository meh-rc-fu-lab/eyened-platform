"""The scope reaches the HTTP boundary, and an invisible row is a 404 there.

Every other authorization test on this branch stops at the repository or at the
dependency in isolation; the `client` fixture hands all route tests an admin
scope, so nothing exercised request -> get_access_scope -> service ->
repository -> apply_scope -> 404 end to end. A filter that is correct in a unit
test and never reaches a handler is not enforcement.
