"""The CLI shell: tests for the things the shell adds over the functions.

Everything else is tested in test_authz_administration.py, which does not need
a real Database(). The accept path is not retested here: parse_role's happy
path is pinned there, and a CLI-level version of it could only assert that an
error string is *absent* from the output -- which is equally true of any
unrelated failure, so it would pass whether or not the parse ran.

`grant_all`'s confirmation prompt is tested here too, for the same reason:
`click.confirm(abort=True)` has no function-level equivalent, so only the CLI
shell can prove it actually gates the write.
