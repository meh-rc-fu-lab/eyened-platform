"""Pure query construction for the search surfaces.

Framework-agnostic SQLAlchemy: takes a Session and already-resolved ORM
predicates, returns rows and counts. UI vocabulary never reaches this module --
callers resolve labels to ORM attributes before calling in.

Carries three known query-shape inefficiencies verbatim (the attribute-def N+1,
the OR-of-joins EXISTS, and the redundant DISTINCT in instances_for_studies).
They are deliberate follow-up work, gated on an EXPLAIN ANALYZE baseline against
real MySQL; the SQLite suite can prove rows are unchanged but not that a rewrite
is faster. Do not "fix" them here.

Read-scoping coverage of SearchRepository's twelve public methods:

Seven row/count/value-returning methods scope before returning data the
caller's project memberships allow: search_instances, count_instances,
search_studies, count_studies, studies_by_ids, instances_for_studies, and
visible_project_names. The last of these filters Project.ProjectID directly
against the scope's accessible set rather than going through apply_scope,
since Project has no anchor route for that helper to walk -- it is the
anchor every other entity's route leads to, not an entity with a route of
its own.

Four methods are deliberately unfiltered: they read non-project vocabulary
with no project anchor to scope against -- tag_names,
active_form_creator_names, attribute_signature_rows,
resolve_attribute_definitions.

column_values is unfiltered too, and that is safe: every remaining call site
passes Creator, DeviceModel, Feature or FormSchema, all non-project
vocabulary. Its former Project-typed call sites (the project-name dropdown on
both search-form signatures) were replaced by visible_project_names above.
Do not add a new column_values(Project, ...) call -- the generic wrapper has
no scoping of its own, and doing so would silently reopen this leak.
