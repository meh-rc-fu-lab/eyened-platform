        its own, different anchor, so a row whose two anchors disagree is
        legitimately readable by a caller who cannot see the image. This is the
        only place that decides, under the caller's scope, whether the image may
        be named at all -- ``form_annotation_to_get`` does not resolve one
        itself, by design.

        Not loading it is therefore **not** the unsafe direction: an unloaded
        relationship reads as withheld, so a caller that skips this emits no
        image id rather than an unscoped one. That is why the flag defaults off:
        forgetting it costs a field, where forgetting the scope would cost the
        secret.

        The cost of asking for it, measured on a single ``get_by_id`` against
        the test database: **2 SELECTs -> 14** for a row that carries an image,
        and 2 -> 2 for a row that does not. ``ImageInstance`` declares its own
        ``lazy="selectin"`` relationships, so loading it cascades into Series,
        Study, Patient, Project, ImageStorage, StorageBackend, the device pair
        and the tag tables -- twelve extra queries, not the one an earlier
        revision of this docstring claimed. Only the response paths pay it.

        ``scope_criteria`` returns None for an administrator (and for an
        unfiltered entity), where a tautology would read as a filter that is in
        force. Same predicate as ``apply_scope`` puts on an ImageInstance read,
